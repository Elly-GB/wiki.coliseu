          <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
          <p>
            Elected in 2007 as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World, the Colosseum, located in the capital of Italy, Rome, has many stories that reveal its past, being an example of Roman architecture that highlights the skill of the builders and engineers of Ancient Rome. It was built in the 1st century, around 70 AD, during the government of Vespasian, and completed during the government of his son, Titus, totaling between 6 and 8 years of construction.
          <h3> CURIOSITY </h3>
          <p>
            It is believed that the name “Colosseum” was given to this building because it was located on top of the artificial lake of Nero’s house (built after a fire in the region), which had a statue of the emperor, called “Colossus”. However, during the period in which the Flavian Dynasty was in power, it was called “Flavian Amphitheatre”.
