          <h2>HISTORY</h2>
          <p>
            With the purpose of entertaining the population, it provided several attractions, such as the 100 days of games in the arenas, held to celebrate its inauguration, where it was possible to watch naval battles (where the Colosseum was flooded), gladiator fights, wrestling, animal hunts and executions. <br>
            It was used for 5 centuries, as in the 5th century it was hit and damaged by an earthquake (later restored). Years later, it was used as a military base, and during the Renaissance it was robbed several times, losing a large part of its valuable materials.
